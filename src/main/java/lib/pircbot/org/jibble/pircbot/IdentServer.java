/**
 * A simple IdentServer (also know as "The Identification Protocol").
 * An ident server provides a means to determine the identity of a
 * user of a particular TCP connection.
 * <p/>
 * Most IRC servers attempt to contact the ident server on connecting
 * hosts in order to determine the user's identity.  A few IRC servers
 * will not allow you to connect unless this information is provided.
 * <p/>
 * So when a PircBot is run on a machine that does not run an ident server,
 * it may be necessary to provide a "faked" response by starting up its
 * own ident server and sending out apparently correct responses.
 * <p/>
 * An instance of this class can be used to start up an ident server
 * only if it is possible to do so.  Reasons for not being able to do
 * so are if there is already an ident server running on port 113, or
 * if you are running as an unprivileged user who is unable to create
 * a server socket on that port number.
