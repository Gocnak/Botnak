/**
 * This class implements a mechanism to play a media item and wait for it to start (or wait for it
 * to raise an error instead of starting).
 * <p/>
 * Ordinarily a call to play new media returns immediately and the native media player attempts to
 * open and start playing the media asynchronously. This can make it a little difficult for
 * application code to know if the media successfully started or failed to start because of an
 * error.
 * <p/>
 * It is possible for application code to respond to media player events to determine whether the
 * media started successfully or failed because of an error but this class serves as a convenient
 * encapsulation of that functionality.
 * <p/>
 * The strategy is simply to block the play call until a media player "playing" or "error" event is
 * received.
 * <p/>
 * Example usage:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * mediaPlayer.prepareMedia(mrl, options);
 * boolean definitelyStarted = new MediaPlayerLatch(mediaPlayer).play();
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * The {@link DefaultMediaPlayer} uses this class for the "play and wait..." implementation, see
 * {@link MediaPlayer#startMedia(String, String...)}.
 * <p/>
 * Most applications are not expected to need this class and use the "start media" functionality on
 * the media player instead.
