/**
 * Media player implementation that provides direct access to the audio buffer data.
 * <p/>
 * Client applications specify the decoded audio buffer format, the sample rate (in Hz) and the
 * number of audio channels.
 * <p/>
 * The standard format for the decoded audio is "S16N".
 * <p/>
 * Client applications respond to native callbacks by providing an implementation of
 * {@link AudioCallback} or {@link AudioCallbackAdapter}.
 * <p/>
 * When using the direct audio player then obviously the audio is not played - if a client
 * application needs the audio to be heard then the client application must play the audio samples
 * itself (e.g. via JavaSound or some other library).
 * <p/>
 * The main callback is "play", whereby a number of decoded audio samples are presented - the
 * number of audio samples does <em>not</em> equate to the size of the audio buffer, the "block
 * size" for a sample must also be considered.
