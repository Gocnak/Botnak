/**
 * Implementation of an MMS media resource locator.
 * <p/>
 * This class provides a fluent API for initialising the MRL, e.g.
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * String mrl = new MmsMrl().host("www.myhost.com")
 *                          .port("8000")
 *                          .path("/mediainfo")
 *                          .value();
 * </pre>
 * This will generate <code>"mms://www.myhost.com:8000/mediainfo"</code>.
