/**
 * JNA interface to the native LibDwm (Desktop Window Manager) library.
 * <p/>
 * This library is only available on Windows platforms.
 * <p/>
 * The functionality provided by this library may be helpful especially when working with
 * full-screen exclusive mode in Java which suffers from numerous idiosyncrasies on Windows, some of
 * which can be mitigated by ensuring that desktop window composition is disabled. Disabling
 * composition can be done at the operating system level, but is more convenient for end-users if
 * the application itself does it.
 * <p/>
 * <strong>This class may be removed in future versions of vlcj due to it's uselessness.</strong>
