 * This class is the container for all of the default

 * This was created to change permissions of the aforementioned
 * commands to either full permission classes (all mods, or everyone)
 * or to specific people in the chat, regardless of status in the chat.
 * <p>
 * >> If you want more commands added, you will have to hard-code them! <<
 * <p>
 * The reason this is called *Console*Command is that these commands
 * directly change something about Botnak, or require specific code.
