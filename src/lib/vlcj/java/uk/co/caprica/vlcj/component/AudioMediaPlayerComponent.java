/**
 * Encapsulation of an audio player.
 * <p/>
 * Most implementation details, like creating a factory, are encapsulated.
 * <p/>
 * The default implementation will work out-of-the-box, but there are various template methods
 * available to sub-classes to tailor the behaviour of the component.
 * <p/>
 * This class implements the most the most common use-case for an audio player and is intended to
 * enable a developer to get quickly started with the vlcj framework. More advanced applications are
 * free to directly use the {@link MediaPlayerFactory}, if required, as has always been the case.
 * <p/>
 * This component also adds implements the various media player listener interfaces, consequently an
 * implementation sub-class can simply override those listener methods to handle events.
 * <p/>
 * Applications can get a handle to the underlying media player object by invoking
 * {@link #getMediaPlayer()}.
 * <p/>
 * To use, simply create an instance of this class.
 * <p/>
 * In this minimal example, only two lines of code are required to create an audio player and play
 * media:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * mediaPlayerComponent = new AudioMediaPlayerComponent(); // &lt;--- 1
 * mediaPlayerComponent.getMediaPlayer().playMedia(mrl); // &lt;--- 2
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * This is not quite as useful as the {@link EmbeddedMediaPlayerComponent} as audio players are
 * generally quite simple to create anyway.
 * <p/>
 * An audio player may still have a user interface, but it will not have an associated video
 * surface.
 * <p/>
 * When the media player component is no longer needed, it should be released by invoking the
 * {@link #release()} method.
 * <p/>
 * Since the media player factory associated by this component may be created by this component
 * itself or may be shared with some other media player resources it is the responsibility of
 * the application to also release the media player factory at the appropriate time.
 * <p/>
 * It is always a better strategy to reuse media player components, rather than repeatedly creating
 * and destroying instances.
