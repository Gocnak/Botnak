/**
 * Default implementation of a media player condition that triggers if the media
 * player reports an error or unexpectedly reaches the end of the media.
 * <p/>
 * This is useful when waiting for a condition that is normally expected (such as
 * waiting until a particular media player state is reached, or a particular play-
 * back time is reached) and the media player unexpectedly reports an error or
 * reports that the end of the media has been reached.
 * <p/>
 * Without this, a condition may wait forever, since after an error or after the
 * media has finished <em>no more events</em> will be received.
 * <p/>
 * It is expected that <em>most</em> but not necessarily all {@link Condition}
 * implementations will need this behaviour.
 * <p/>
 * Do not override {@link #error(MediaPlayer)} or {@link #finished()} unless you
 * are sure you know what you are doing. Some use-cases may require that those
 * methods can be overridden, so if you do provide an override you must be careful
 * to invoke the superclass method for correct operation.
 *
 * @param <T> optional type of result
