/**
 * A one-time media list iterator.
 * <p/>
 * For simplicities sake, and since this is a <em>private implementation
 * class</em>, the iterator may not be re-used and the implementation takes some liberties to ensure
 * that native resources are properly released.
 * <p/>
 * Specifically, the native media instance for each sub-item must be explicitly released. The only
 * reliable place to carry this out is in the {@link #hasNext()} method implementation.
 * <p/>
 * Consequently a user of this class <strong>must</strong> invoke {@link #hasNext()} after
 * processing each sub item. Since in any event this is the typical usage pattern for an iterator,
 * this is no big deal.
 * <p/>
 * The reason that this class is used, despite the issues described above, is that it makes the code
 * in the media player implementation that deals with sub-items a lot simpler and reduces a lot of
 * code duplication when iterating the sub-items.
