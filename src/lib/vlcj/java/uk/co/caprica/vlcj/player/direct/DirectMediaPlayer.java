 * Specification for a media player that provides direct access to the video frame data.
 * <p/>
 * Such a media player is useful for user interface toolkits that do not support the embedding of an
 * AWT Canvas, like JavaFX or an OpenGL toolkit like jMonkeyEngine.
 * <p/>
 * A direct media player is also useful for applications that need access to the video frame data to
 * process it in some way.
